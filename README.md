## Analysis of X chromosome inactivation erosion in iPSCs.

This repo contains codes written for the analysis of X chromosome inactivation erosion in human induced pluripotent stem cells, the results of which has been presented in the paper [X-chromosome inactivation in human iPSCs provides insight into escape-regulated gene expression](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.25.563960v1).
